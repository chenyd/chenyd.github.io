I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Computer Science Department at <a href='https://www.cornell.edu'>Cornell University</a>, working with Prof. <a href='https://wensun.github.io/'>Wen Sun</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href='https://www.wisc.edu/'>University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison</a>, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href='https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/'>Jerry Zhu</a>. My research focuses on generative models, reinforcement learning, mechanism design, and robust statistics.
